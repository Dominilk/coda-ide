# codaIDE
This is the IDE for my own programming language.
My programming language has been in the works now for about 3 moths and I figured that
making an IDE would be a good decision. Right now codaIDE has syntax highlighting support for 
java and coda. More will be added soon though. I would definetly not consider this project
done because there are still several bugs and no highlighting support for for example xml.

Thanks for reading,
Feel free to give a **star** if you like what you see :)
